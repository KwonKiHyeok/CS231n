In 2017, Vaswani et al introduced the Transformer in their paper [\"Attention Is All You Need\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) to a) introduce parallelism and b) allow models to learn long-range dependencies. The paper not only led to famous models like BERT and GPT in the natural language processing community, but also an explosion of interest across fields, including vision.

        "1. **Using multiple attention heads as opposed to one** <br>\n",
        "Using multiple attention heads allows the model to capture various relationships between different positions in parallel. A single head can only focus on one type of relationship, which limits the representational capacity, whereas multiple heads can simultaneously attend to different aspects such as context, syntactic structure, and semantic associations, resulting in richer representations.\n",

        "2. **Dividing by 𝑑 / ℎ before applying the softmax function** <br>\n",
        "The dot product between queries and keys can produce large variance when the feature dimension is high, which may lead the softmax output to become extremely small or biased. Dividing by 𝑑 / ℎ normalizes the scale of the scores, stabilizes the variance, and ensures that the softmax yields well-behaved gradients for effective and stable learning.\n",

        "3. **Adding a linear transformation to the output of the attention operation** <br>\n",
        "Simply concatenating the outputs from multiple heads results in disjoint subspace representations that lack meaningful integration. A linear transformation projects these concatenated outputs into a unified space, allowing the model to form coherent and task-relevant representations."
